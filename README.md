## shelter-analysis

Project in progress: 
The goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of Austin Animal Center's intakes of animals and their outcomes, 2013 to July 2021. The source csvs were obtained from Kaggle from [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics?select=Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv). 

Some initial avenues for analysis are connections between breeds and adoptions, an animal being named and survival outcomes, and the reproduction status of animals (neutered/spayed vs. intact) and ownership status.
